# Business Problem

*  We have developed the grouped bar graph to analyze the months with highest and lowest reservation levels according to reservation status. As can be seen, both the number of confirmed reservations and the numbers of canceled reservation are largest in the month of August, whereas January is the month with the most canceled reservation.

* Around 46% of the clients come from online travel agencies, whereas 27% are coming from Direct or Groups.
only 4% of clients book hotels directly by visiting them and making reservation. 
----------------------------

* As seen in the graph, reservation are canceled when the average daily rate is higher than when it is not canceled. 
It clearly proves that all above analysis, that the higher price leads to higher cancellation .
